# 53. Maximum Subarray   
[링크](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

## 문제 설명

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray 
(containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

> Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.  

> Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, 
try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, 
which is more subtle.
